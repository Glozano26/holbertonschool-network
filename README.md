#Networking Basics #0

##Overview
This README is designed to provide you with fundamental knowledge about networking basics. It covers key concepts, protocols, and terms that are essential for understanding computer networks. By the end of this project, you should be able to explain these concepts to others without relying on external resources.

OSI Model

##What is the OSI Model?
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize how different networking protocols and communication functions interact in a network.

##How many layers does it have?
The OSI Model consists of seven layers, from the physical layer (Layer 1) to the application layer (Layer 7).

##How is it organized?
Each layer of the OSI Model serves a specific function and interacts with adjacent layers through well-defined interfaces, ensuring a systematic approach to networking.

#LAN and WAN Networks

##What is a LAN (Local Area Network)?
A LAN is a network that covers a small geographical area, typically within a single building or campus. It is used for connecting devices like computers and printers for local data sharing and communication.

##What is a WAN (Wide Area Network)?
A WAN is a network that spans a larger geographical area, connecting LANs over long distances. It enables communication between devices or networks in different locations.

##Internet
##What is the Internet?
The Internet is a global network of interconnected computer networks that allows the exchange of data and information across the world.

##IP Address
##What is an IP Address?
An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical label assigned to each device connected to a network. It serves as an identifier, enabling devices to communicate with each other.

##What are the 2 types of IP addresses?
IP addresses can be categorized as private and public. Private IP addresses are used within a local network, while public IP addresses are used to identify a device on the broader internet.

IPv4 and IPv6
Why IPv6 was created?
IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) was created to address the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses due to the exponential growth of internet-connected devices.

Localhost
What is localhost?
Localhost refers to the loopback address (127.0.0.1) on a device, allowing it to communicate with itself. It's often used for testing and development purposes.

TCP and UDP
What are TCP and UDP?
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two primary data transfer protocols in the OSI model. TCP provides reliable, connection-oriented communication, while UDP offers faster, connectionless data transfer.

What is the main difference between TCP and UDP?
TCP ensures data reliability through error-checking and retransmission mechanisms, while UDP prioritizes speed and efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications.

Ports
What is a port?
A port is a logical endpoint for communication in a network. It allows different services on a single device to share a single IP address.

Memorize SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS port numbers
SSH (Secure Shell): Port 22
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): Port 80
HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure): Port 443
Ping and ICMP
What is Ping/ICMP?
Ping is a command-line tool that uses the ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) to test the reachability of a device on a network and measure the round-trip time for data packets.

Positional Parameters
Positional parameters are variables used in shell scripting and programming to reference command-line arguments passed to a script or program.

Tools and Commands
Useful Commands
netstat: A command for displaying network statistics, including active connections and listening ports.
ping: Used to test network connectivity by sending ICMP echo requests.
man or help: Commands to access manual pages and get help on various topics and commands.
This project will equip you with a solid understanding of networking basics, empowering you to navigate and troubleshoot networks effectively. Explore each topic to grasp the essentials and build a strong foundation in the world of networking.
